                    <h2>Cuphead Website</h2>
                    <p>This website was made for a sixth form project.
                        prompted by "a website focusing on music" i chose to
                        make one on the game "Cuphead" that I was playing at the time.
                        For the Design i chose to focus on newspaper designs from the early 30s
                        (a time the game was heavily inspired by), using text faces from the time,
                        and bringing the newspaper design of the time to the modern era with additional
                        features only avalible on mondern devices.

                        Due to the fact this website was developed in a school enviroment on "Wix" it is
                        unable to be viewed by outside viewers but can be viewed in avalible images along 
                        with images of development media.
