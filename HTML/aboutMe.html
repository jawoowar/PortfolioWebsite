                    <h1>Hello, my name is Jennifer Woodward</h1>
                    <p>
                        Im a student at York StJohn University, currently studying Software Engineering.
                        ive had a passion for software and computers as a whole my entire life and chose to persue it
                        as a career because of that love.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        my passion for software lead me down the path to discover the world of design which I took a liking too 
                        after chosing it as a course in sixth form, with my past in art and photography it was simple to get into
                        but opened up alot more for me to explore.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        My art, photography and design can be found across this website along with on my social medias that will be linked below
                        alongside my education, past working experience and a download for my CV.
